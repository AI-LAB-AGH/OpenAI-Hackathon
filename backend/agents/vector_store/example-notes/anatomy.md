# Human Anatomy - Notes

## Skeletal System

The skeletal system provides structural support, protection, and enables movement by connecting with muscles.

### Division of the Skeleton:
- **Axial Skeleton**:
  - Skull
  - Vertebral column (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, coccygeal regions)
  - Rib cage (ribs, sternum)
- **Appendicular Skeleton**:
  - Shoulder girdle (scapula, clavicle)
  - Upper limb (arm, forearm, hand)
  - Pelvic girdle (hip bones, sacrum)
  - Lower limb (thigh, lower leg, foot)

## Muscular System

Muscles enable movement, maintain posture, and assist in thermoregulation.

### Types of Muscles:
- **Skeletal muscles** (striated, voluntary)
- **Cardiac muscle** (striated, involuntary)
- **Smooth muscles** (in internal organs, involuntary)

## Circulatory System

The circulatory system transports oxygen, nutrients, and removes waste products.

### Components of the System:
- **Heart** (four chambers: two atria, two ventricles)
- **Blood vessels**:
  - Arteries
  - Veins
  - Capillaries

### Circulations:
- Pulmonary circulation (lungs)
- Systemic circulation (body)

## Respiratory System

Enables gas exchange â€“ supplies oxygen and removes carbon dioxide.

### Structure of the Respiratory System:
- Nasal cavity
- Pharynx
- Larynx
- Trachea
- Bronchi
- Lungs (alveoli)

## Digestive System

Responsible for digestion of food and absorption of nutrients.

### Organs:
- Oral cavity
- Pharynx
- Esophagus
- Stomach
- Small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum)
- Large intestine (cecum, colon, rectum)
- Liver
- Pancreas
- Gallbladder

## Excretory System

Eliminates waste products of metabolism.

### Main Organs:
- Kidneys
- Ureters
- Urinary bladder
- Urethra

## Nervous System

Controls and coordinates body functions and receives stimuli.

### Division:
- **Central Nervous System (CNS)**:
  - Brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem)
  - Spinal cord
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**:
  - Cranial and spinal nerves

### Functional Division:
- Somatic nervous system (controls voluntary movements)
- Autonomic nervous system (controls involuntary processes)

## Endocrine System

Regulates body functions through hormones secreted into the bloodstream.

### Main Glands:
- Pituitary gland
- Pineal gland
- Thyroid gland
- Parathyroid glands
- Adrenal glands
- Pancreas
- Ovaries (in females)
- Testes (in males)

## Reproductive System

Responsible for reproduction.

### Male Reproductive System:
- Testes
- Epididymides
- Vas deferens
- Seminal vesicles
- Prostate gland
- Penis

### Female Reproductive System:
- Ovaries
- Fallopian tubes
- Uterus
- Vagina
- Vulva

## Skin

The skin protects the body, participates in thermoregulation, and perceives sensory stimuli.

### Structure of the Skin:
- Epidermis
- Dermis
- Subcutaneous tissue

### Skin Appendages:
- Hair
- Nails
- Sebaceous glands
- Sweat glands
