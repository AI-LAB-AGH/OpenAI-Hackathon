# Polynomials - Math Notes

## Definition

A **polynomial** is a mathematical expression involving a sum of powers in one or more variables multiplied by coefficients.

### General form (in one variable):
\[
P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0
\]
Where:
- \( a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0 \) are constants (coefficients),
- \( x \) is a variable,
- \( n \) is a non-negative integer (degree of the polynomial),
- \( a_n 
eq 0 \).

## Types of Polynomials

- **Monomial**: One term (e.g., \(5x^3\))
- **Binomial**: Two terms (e.g., \(x^2 - 4\))
- **Trinomial**: Three terms (e.g., \(x^2 + 3x + 2\))
- **Multinomial**: More than three terms

## Operations with Polynomials

### 1. Addition & Subtraction
Combine like terms.
\[
(3x^2 + 2x + 1) + (x^2 - 4x + 5) = 4x^2 - 2x + 6
\]

### 2. Multiplication
Use distributive property or FOIL method (for binomials).
\[
(x + 2)(x - 3) = x^2 - 3x + 2x - 6 = x^2 - x - 6
\]

### 3. Division
Use polynomial long division or synthetic division.

## Factoring Polynomials

Common techniques:
- Factoring out the GCF
- Difference of squares: \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\)
- Perfect square trinomials
- Factoring trinomials: \(ax^2 + bx + c\)
- Grouping

## Roots and Zeros

A **zero** of a polynomial \(P(x)\) is a value \(x = r\) such that \(P(r) = 0\).

- **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**: Every non-zero polynomial equation of degree \(n\) has exactly \(n\) complex roots (counting multiplicities).

## Graphing Polynomials

Key features:
- **Degree**: Determines the shape and end behavior
- **Leading coefficient**: Affects the direction
- **Zeros**: Where the graph crosses the x-axis
- **Y-intercept**: Value of \(P(0)\)

## Polynomial Theorems

- **Remainder Theorem**: If a polynomial \(P(x)\) is divided by \(x - a\), the remainder is \(P(a)\).
- **Factor Theorem**: \(x - a\) is a factor of \(P(x)\) if and only if \(P(a) = 0\).

## Example Problems

### 1. Factor completely:
\[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)
\]

### 2. Find zeros of:
\[
P(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 \Rightarrow (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)
\]
