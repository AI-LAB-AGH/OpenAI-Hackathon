## 1. Introduction
Genetics is the branch of biology that studies heredity and the mechanisms by which genetic information is passed from one generation to the next. In high school, basic genetic concepts, the structure of nucleic acids, and the processes of DNA expression and replication are covered. This note aims to collect and systematize the key topics in genetics at the high school level.

## 2. Basic Genetic Concepts

### 2.1. Gene, Allele, Locus
- **Gene**: the unit of heredity, a segment of DNA that encodes specific information (e.g., a protein or RNA).  
- **Allele**: different versions of the same gene found at the same position (locus) on a chromosome.  
- **Locus**: the specific location on a chromosome where a gene is found.

### 2.2. Chromosomes and Karyotype
- **Chromosomes**: structures made of DNA and proteins (histones) containing genes.  
- **Karyotype**: the complete set of chromosomes characteristic of a species or individual.  
- In humans: 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), including 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY).

---

## 3. Structure and Functions of Nucleic Acids

### 3.1. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
- Double helix composed of nucleotides: nitrogenous bases (A, T, G, C), deoxyribose sugar, and phosphate group.  
- Base pairing: A–T (2 hydrogen bonds), G–C (3 hydrogen bonds).  
- Functions: storage of genetic information, template for replication and transcription.

### 3.2. RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)
- Single-stranded chain of nucleotides: bases A, U (instead of T), G, C; ribose sugar.  
- Types:
  - **mRNA** (messenger RNA): carries information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  
  - **tRNA** (transfer RNA): brings amino acids during translation.  
  - **rRNA** (ribosomal RNA): makes up ribosomes.

---

## 4. DNA Replication

The process of copying genetic material before cell division.
1. **Initiation**: unwinding of the double helix (helicase), formation of replication forks.  
2. **Elongation**: synthesis of new strands:
   - **Leading strand**: synthesized continuously.  
   - **Lagging strand**: synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  
   - **Enzymes**: DNA polymerase, primase, ligase.  
3. **Termination**: joining of Okazaki fragments, proofreading and error correction.

---

## 5. Gene Expression

### 5.1. Transcription
Copying information from DNA to RNA.
1. **RNA polymerase** binds to the gene’s promoter.  
2. Synthesis of mRNA in the 5′→3′ direction.  
3. Termination at a terminator sequence.  
4. Post-transcriptional modifications (in eukaryotes): capping, polyadenylation, splicing (removal of introns).

### 5.2. Translation
Converting mRNA nucleotide sequence into an amino acid sequence.
1. **Initiation**: ribosome binds to mRNA at the start codon (AUG).  
2. **Elongation**: tRNA delivers amino acids matching codons; peptide bonds form.  
3. **Termination**: stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) signal release of the polypeptide.

### 5.3. Regulation of Gene Expression
- **Prokaryotes**: operon models (lac, trp).  
- **Eukaryotes**: transcription factors, chromatin modification, RNA interference (RNAi).

---

## 6. Mendel’s Laws and Inheritance Principles

### 6.1. Law of Segregation
Alleles separate during gamete formation so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.

### 6.2. Law of Independent Assortment
Alleles of different genes assort independently during gamete formation, provided genes are on different chromosomes.

### 6.3. Crosses and Phenotypic Analysis
- Monohybrid (single-gene) and dihybrid (two-gene) crosses.  
- Analysis of phenotypic and genotypic ratios in F1 and F2 generations.

---

## 7. Types of Inheritance

### 7.1. Autosomal Dominant and Recessive Inheritance
- **Dominant**: trait expressed when at least one dominant allele is present (e.g., Huntington's disease).  
- **Recessive**: trait expressed only when two recessive alleles are present (e.g., cystic fibrosis).

### 7.2. Sex-Linked Inheritance
Genes located on sex chromosomes (X, Y). Examples: hemophilia, color blindness.

### 7.3. Multifactorial Inheritance
Influence of multiple genes and environmental factors (e.g., height, weight, hypertension).

---

## 8. Mutations

### 8.1. Types of Mutations
- **Point mutations**: substitutions, insertions, deletions of single nucleotides.  
- **Structural mutations**: large deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations.

### 8.2. Causes and Effects of Mutations
- Causes: replication errors, chemical agents, radiation.  
- Effects: altered amino acid sequence, loss of protein function, genetic diseases, evolution.

---

## 9. Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering

### 9.1. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
Technique for amplifying DNA fragments in vitro through cycles of denaturation, primer annealing, and extension by Taq polymerase.

### 9.2. Gene and Organism Cloning
- **Gene cloning**: inserting a gene into a vector (plasmid) and transforming bacteria.  
- **Somatic cell nuclear transfer**: cloning organisms (e.g., Dolly the sheep).

### 9.3. GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms)
Organisms with introduced or altered genes, e.g., pest-resistant crops.

## 10. Genetic Diseases

Examples:
- Autosomal recessive: cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria.  
- Autosomal dominant: Huntington's disease.  
- X-linked: hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

---

## 11. Genetic Analysis Methods

- **DNA sequencing** (Sanger, NGS).  
- **Gel electrophoresis**.  
- **PCR and qPCR**.  
- **DNA microarrays**.

## 12. Summary
Genetics is the foundation for understanding biology and medicine. Knowledge of DNA structure, replication, transcription, translation, and inheritance principles is essential for research and practical applications, such as genetic disease diagnostics and genetic engineering.
